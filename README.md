This macOS VM hosted in a server is completely free and includes Xcode, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and much more!
Just connect with a VNC client to the URL provided by ngrok, install Teamviewer, set the necessary permissions, enter the ID an the password on your client and voila! Free high performance macOS VM server hosted!
Unfortunately, there is no audio support.

Hello everyone! Welcome to my repository! (credits to spyboyxda1 for the original repository)
You don't need to rent servers offered from example Macincloud!
These macOS VMs hosted in a server are completely free and they include Xcode, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and much more!
Just connect with a VNC client to the URL provided by ngrok, install Teamviewer, enter the ID an the password on your client, set the necessary permissions and voila! Free high performance macOS VMs server hosted!
Unfortunately, there is no audio support. 
Follow the tutorial on my yt channel for the full version of this tutorial:
